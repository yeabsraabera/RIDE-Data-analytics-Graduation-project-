# RIDE-Data-analytics-Graduation-project-

🚖 Ride-Hailing Data Analysis & Visualization
📌 Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and visualization of ride-hailing and ride-sharing services. The goal is to explore ride request data, identify demand patterns, and provide insights through interactive dashboards and charts.

While originally inspired by my idea of Egremenged (a local Ethiopian ride-sharing service), the project is designed to be general and applicable to any ride-hailing platform such as Uber, Bolt, Lyft, or Yango.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze ride request data to discover demand trends.

Visualize peak hours, high-demand zones, and ride frequencies.

Demonstrate how data analysis and visualization can support better decision-making in mobility services.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python, SQL

Data Processing: Pandas, PySpark (optional), Jupyter Notebook

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI / Tableau

Storage (for datasets): CSV / Parquet files

📊 Example Insights

Peak Hours: When most passengers request rides.

Geographic Demand: Which city zones have the highest ride activity.

Day vs Night Trends: How ride-sharing behavior changes over time.

Ride Duration & Distance Patterns: Insights into trip characteristics.

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone : (https://github.com/yeabsraabera/RIDE-Data-analytics-Graduation-project-)
Open the analysis notebook:


jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb


Run the cells to explore data analysis and visualizations.

✨ Future Improvements

Add real-time dashboards using Grafana or Streamlit.

Expand dataset with GPS traces for better geographic insights.

Include predictive analytics for demand forecasting.
